# **Data Warehouse and Analytics Project**

**Data Warehouse and Analytics Project** repository!

This project presents a complete data warehousing and analytics solution—from building a data warehouse to delivering actionable business insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it showcases best practices in modern **data engineering**, **ETL**, **data modeling**, and **analytics**.

---

## Data Architecture

This project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:

* **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data ingested from source systems (CSV files) directly into a SQL Server database.
* **Silver Layer**: Performs data cleansing, normalization, and standardization to prepare the data for analysis.
* **Gold Layer**: Contains business-ready data modeled in a **star schema** for reporting and analytics.

## Project Overview

The project covers the following:

* **Data Architecture**: Designing a modern data warehouse using Medallion Architecture.
* **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from ERP and CRM systems into the warehouse.
* **Data Modeling**: Creating **dimension** and **fact** tables optimized for analytical workloads.
* **Analytics & Reporting**: Writing SQL-based reports and dashboards to uncover insights.

## Project Requirements

### Data Engineering: Build the Data Warehouse

**Objective**: Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data for better decision-making.

**Key Specs:**

* **Data Sources**: ERP and CRM systems (CSV files)
* **Data Quality**: Clean and standardize the data before loading
* **Integration**: Merge sources into one analytical model
* **Scope**: Focus on the most recent data (no historization)
* **Documentation**: Provide clear data model documentation for analysts and business users
